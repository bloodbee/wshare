<h1 align="center">WShare (Website Share) - Chrome and Firefox extension</h1>

*Share your visited websites to friends on any social network based on your rules.*

## Main features
- Create rules to filter on desired websites.
- Remove undesired websites before sharing.
- Share your list on any social network.
- Clear your list or create a new one.

## How does it work?
This extension for Chrome and Firefox will look into websites sources (and especially key sections) to find a keyword defined by your rules.
If a rule is found, the current url is added to the list.

After that, you can easily share your list to friends.

## Contributing - Pull Requests
PRs are welcome. 
1. Create a PR to add a new feature, fix a bug or some typo.
2. At a minimum these files need to be updated: `README.md` and `manifest-ff.json`.
3. Follow existing code-style and use camelCase.
4. Use [JavaScript Semi-Standard Style linter](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Don't need to follow it exactly..
